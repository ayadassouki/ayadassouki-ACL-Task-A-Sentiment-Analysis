# ACL Task A â€“ Sentiment Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of **ACL Task A** from the **ACL Shared Task on Sentiment Analysis**, where we fine-tuned **Google's Gemini LLM** to enhance sentiment classification performance. The goal was to accurately classify text samples based on emotional tone while considering **bias and fairness metrics** in language model outputs.

## ðŸš€ Methods Used
- **Dataset Preparation:** Preprocessed text data for sentiment classification.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuned **Gemini LLM** for improved classification accuracy.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Experimented with various prompt structures to optimize results.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Used accuracy, precision, recall, and **fairness metrics** to assess model performance.

## ðŸ”¬ Results & Findings
### Classification Performance:
| Emotion   | Pre-Fine-Tuning Accuracy | Post-Fine-Tuning Accuracy |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Anger     | 80%                      | 91%                       |
| Fear      | 46%                      | 80%                       |
| Joy       | 67%                      | 86%                       |
| Sadness   | 54%                      | 84%                       |
| Surprise  | 64%                      | 83%                       |

- **Significant Improvements:** Accuracy increased across all emotion categories, with performance boosts ranging from **17% to 34%**.
- **Enhanced Fairness:** Fine-tuning helped mitigate biases, leading to more balanced precision and recall values.
